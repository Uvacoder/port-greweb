It is [common][3] in Javascript to have unexpected behaviors, but this one is particulary vicious.

> 10000000000000000 === 10000000000000001

**Javascript doesn’t have integer type but lets you think it has.** `parseInt` and `parseFloat` built-in functions, the fact that “1″ is displayed as “1″ and not as “1.0″ (like many languages) contribute to the general misunderstood.

**In Javascript, all numbers are floating numbers and are prone to [floating point approximation][4].**

When you write `var i = 1;`, and you console.log it, Javascript is nice, you obtain `1` and not `1.0000000000000001`. 

But you can experiment that, in Javascript, `1.0000000000000001 === 1` is true…

> I hear you, telling me that *this sounds OK, floating point approximation rules, right?*

But the same thing occurs for big numbers:

```javascript
10000000000000000 === 10000000000000001
```

Oh **F\*\*K** !

## Termination of loops

The following is worse:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4504986.js"></script>

is logging `10000000000000000` forever!

Because 10000000000000001 can’t exist in Javascript with approximations, 10000000000000001 is 10000000000000000, so you can’t increment this value, and you are stuck in this crazy f\*\*king loop. 

Conclusion, *Program termination proof* sounds hard to reach in Javascript!

## How many numbers in a 1000 range?

Between 10000000000000000 and 10000000000001000, there are actually 750 Javascript integers.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4505510.js"></script>

## Real World Example

The issue can actually **lead to real web application disaster**. Imagine if your database use Long for id (well like almost every databases in the world, like twitter does), and **if you use the id as number in Javascript and not as string**, you can have strange behaviors like never being able to represent and access a resource from the Javascript or worse!

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4505517.js"></script>

## TL;DR. The lesson

This is not something new, floating point approximation, but the way Javascript fix values to round the approximations mislead us.

Now, simple thing, **Avoid numbers when approximation is not permitted** like for resource id (especially when you retrieve it from a server).

This probably impacts your JSON APIs because it’s the last thing you had think of!

Otherwise, **if you need to manipulate big integers in Javascript use a library for that**.

[EDIT]  
9007199254740993 (which is 2^53 1) is the smallest not representable integer in Javascript. In other words, you can trust Javascript numbers before this integer!

[EDIT 2]  
[Thanks to 0×0 on HackerNews][6] who told me the twitter id issue example really happened in a previous twitter API:
