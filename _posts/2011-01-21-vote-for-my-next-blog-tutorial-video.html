Hi readers.

Like in the past, I have decided to restart to do some video tutorials and podcasts, but this time to share my new experience in web architecture and programming.

I have lot of ideas of video podcast around <strong>new web technologies</strong> but I don't have much time to do all of them.
So I'm going back to the real goal, I mean <strong>YOU</strong>, readers ! I will ask you through a vote <strong>what do you expect the next video podcast?</strong> This is a new concept I'm experimenting.

<strong>I'm expecting lot of votes before closing them, so feel free to share the news.</strong>
I intend to release a video every 2 or 3 months about.
