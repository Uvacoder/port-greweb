I make a simple canvas game in **HTML5 Canvas**.

**Canvas is a really great API** which allows to do awesome things combined with **javascript** language. It’s a **standard alternative to Flash** and for that kind of usage, I think it can fairly compete Flash.

You can test the game in a **recent browser** *(canvas-compatible like firefox, chrome, …)* **following [this link][2]**.

If you want to **hack the code**, see the javascript [here][3].

The game was simple to code, except maybe the animation managment which require some **optimization perspective**. The code source is still not perfect, I may improve soon.
