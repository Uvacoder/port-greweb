Hi readers.

Like in the past, I have decided to restart to do some video tutorials and podcasts, but this time to share my new experience in web architecture and programming.

I have lot of ideas of video podcast around **new web technologies** but I don’t have much time to do all of them.  
So I’m going back to the real goal, I mean **YOU**, readers ! I will ask you through a vote **what do you expect the next video podcast?** This is a new concept I’m experimenting.

**I’m expecting lot of votes before closing them, so feel free to share the news.**  
I intend to release a video every 2 or 3 months about.

(I don’t know if I’ll do it in English but if it’s in French, I’ll probably put subtitles)
